# Media Slideshow Plugin for Kodi

**Slideshow Plugin** has been adopted and redesigned to entertain you when 
_Kodi_ media player runs audio content, displaying graphical media about 
current song/artict(s)/albums/etc.
 
This addon was design to run over __Clue__ system but it might work also 
on any _Kodi_ instance (version 17+) both Python v2 and v3 versions.The only
one dependency is related to `module.clue` which is required through the 
installation process. 

Development, testing and deployment activities are driven by CCM process (Clue 
Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
try `make help`.

_Enjoy!_
