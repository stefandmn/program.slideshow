# Media Slideshow Plugin for MCPi

**Slideshow Plugin** has been adopted and redesigned to entertain you when 
Clue MCPi media player runs audio content, displaying graphical media about 
current song/artict(s)/albums/etc.
 
This plugin was design to run over ___Clue OS___ but it might work also 
on any Kodi version, over any _Debian_ operating system installed on RPi 
appliances.
