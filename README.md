# Media Slideshow Plugin for Kodi

**Slideshow Plugin** has been adopted and redesigned to entertain you when 
_Kodi_ media player runs audio content, displaying graphical media about 
current song/artict(s)/albums/etc.
 
This plugin was design to run over __Clue__ system but it might work also 
on any _Kodi_ version.

Development, testing and deployment activities are driven by CCM process (Clue 
Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
try `make help`.

_Enjoy!_
